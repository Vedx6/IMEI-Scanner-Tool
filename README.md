# IMEI Scanner Tool

This is a small static web tool that queries multiple IMEI-info APIs and includes a local demo database and owner lookup.

Quick start
1. Create a local `config.js` (see `.env.example`) and add your paid API URL. Do NOT commit `config.js`.
2. Open `imei_info_checker.html` in your browser (or serve the folder with a static server).

Files of interest
- `imei_info_checker.html` — main UI and app logic.
- `config.js` — local file you must create (ignored by git). Put your paid API URL here.
- `app.js` — small loader that reads `window.env.PAID_API_URL`.

Security
- Never commit `config.js` or any secret API keys. Use a server-side proxy or serverless function for production to keep paid keys private.

How to push
1. Initialize a repo inside this folder, commit, add the GitHub remote, then push `main`.
2. Example (PowerShell):
```
cd "C:\Users\Vedxz\OneDrive\Desktop\Tools"
git init
git add .
git commit -m "Initial commit: IMEI scanner tool (config.js ignored)"
git remote add origin https://github.com/Vedx6/IMEI-Scanner-Tool.git
git push -u origin main
```

If you want, I can run these steps for you now and push to the repository.
